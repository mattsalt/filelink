# filelink

Simple storage service to share files via links. Upload a file, get a link. Share this link with whoever you like and they can download the file for 7 days. After 7 days your file is removed.

Future Improvements
1. HTTPS
2. Use non local hash store to allow clustering
3. Support larger files
4. Encrypt files if possible -> https://gist.github.com/PaulMougel/7511372
